        "# What AD Is Not ?\n",
        "Without a clear introduction, many people place automatic differentiation (AD) in the same category as numerical differentiation or symbolic differentiation. This confusion is understandable because AD delivers numerical values for derivatives while using the rules of symbolic calculus, yet it only stores the resulting numbers rather than the complete algebraic expressions. This dual character means AD operates in a space that overlaps both approaches (Griewank, 2003). To start, we will explain how AD differs from those two familiar methods and in many respects exceeds their capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "## AD Is Not Numerical Differentiation\n",
        "Numerical differentiation estimates a derivative by applying finite difference formulas to function values sampled at specific points (Burden & Faires, 2001). At its core, the method springs directly from the limit definition of the derivative. For example, for a multivariate function $f∶R^n→R$, one can approximate the gradient $(\\frac{∂f}{∂x_1 },…,\\frac{∂f}{∂x_n})$ using:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\frac{∂f(x)}{∂x_i} \\approx \\frac{f(x+he_i )-f(x)}{h}\\text{ (Eq.1)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "where $e_i$ is the $i$-th unit vector and $h>0$ is a small step size. Its main upside is simplicity of implementation; the downsides are that computing a gradient in $n$ dimensions needs $O(n)$ separate evaluations of $f$ and that you must choose the step size $h$ with great care.\n",
        "\n",
        "Approximating derivatives numerically is fundamentally unstable and suffers from poor conditioning, except when using complex variable techniques that apply only to certain holomorphic functions (Fornberg, 1981). This instability arises from truncation errors and round off errors introduced by finite computational precision and the selection of the step size $h$. While the truncation error vanishes as $h$ approaches zero $(h→0)$, reducing $h$ increases the round off error until it becomes the primary source of inaccuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Various methods have been proposed to reduce the approximation error in numerical differentiation. For example, using a central difference formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\frac{∂f(x)}{∂x_i} \\approx \\frac{f(x+he_i )-f(x-he_i)}{2h} + O(h^2 )\\text{ (Eq.2)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "in which the leading order errors cancel out, pushing the truncation error from first order to second order in $h$. In one dimension, this central difference (Eq. 2) is just as expensive as the forward difference (Eq. 1) because both require two evaluations of $f$. But in higher dimensions the cost grows quickly: forming the full Jacobian of a map $f∶R^n→R^m$ using central differences demands $2mn$ function evaluations, forcing a trade off between accuracy and computational expense.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advanced approaches to enhance numerical differentiation, such as higher order finite difference schemes, Richardson extrapolation toward the limit (Brezinski & Zaglia, 1991), and weighted sum differential quadrature methods (Bert & Malik, 1996), all raise computational cost, never fully remove approximation errors, and remain highly vulnerable to floating point truncation. Moreover, the $O(n)$ expense of computing an $n$-dimensional gradient makes numerical differentiation impractical for machine learning, where $n$ can reach millions or billions in cutting edge deep networks (Shazeer et al., 2017). By contrast, deep learning models tolerate approximation errors reasonably well thanks to their intrinsic resilience to numerical noise (Gupta et al., 2015).\n",

        "## AD Is Not Symbolic Differentiation\n",
        "\n",
        "Symbolic differentiation refers to the automated transformation of mathematical expressions to derive their exact derivative formulas (Grabmeier and Kaltofen, 2003). This is achieved by systematically applying differentiation rules, for example:\n",

        "When mathematical formulas are stored as structured data, differentiating an expression tree by symbolic means becomes a fully mechanical task, an idea that dates back to the earliest days of calculus (Leibniz, 1685). Today, this approach is implemented in computer algebra systems like Mathematica, Maxima, and Maple, as well as in machine learning libraries such as Theano.\n",
        "\n",
        "In optimization, symbolic derivatives can reveal the underlying structure of a problem and sometimes even yield closed-form solutions for extrema( such as solving for $\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)=0$) bypassing the need for further derivative evaluations. However, symbolic derivatives often expand into expressions that grow exponentially in size compared to the original formula, making them impractical for efficient runtime computation of derivative values.\n",
